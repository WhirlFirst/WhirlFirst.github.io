I am a PhD candidate at Tsinghua University, supervised by Professor [Xuegong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o2ZRDe4AAAAJ). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2020 from the Department of Automation, at Tsinghua University.
My research interests are developing advanced AI models on omics data analysis, expanding the application scenarios and boundaries of AI models in biological data. Especially, I am working on building foundation models and generative models for scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics.
